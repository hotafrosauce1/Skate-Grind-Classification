# Skate Grind Image Classification Project

This is a project in which I trained a Convolutional Neural Network to classify various skateboarding grinds performed in images.
The different classes images can be classified into include:
* **5-0 Grind**
* **50-50 Grind**
* **Crooked Grind or Overcrooked Grind or Nose Grind**
* **Feeble Grind**
* **Lipslide or Boardslide**
* **Noseslide or Tailslide**
* **Smith Grind**

Sometimes, The **.ipynb** Jupyter Notebook file won't open on Github for some reason.  If that's the case, just
[click here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hotafrosauce1/Skate-Grind-Classification/blob/master/Trick%20Classification.ipynb) to see the rendered Jupyter Notebook.
